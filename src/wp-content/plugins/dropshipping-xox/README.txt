[Dropshix](https://www.dropshix.com/) is built based on your feedbacks, expect it to be more personalized than any other tool. As long as the input is not against the law or it won't risk your business we'll try our best to make it happen.

Our main features:

* **Product Importer Tool**

	The plugin has a feature to collect items information directly from source website (real time), we've created an algorithm that will list all of the best, most popular and most favorite items sold by the highest rated sellers in source website directly inside your WordPress admin panel. The system will provide all the most important information needed by a dropshipper to make a decision whether they want to sell the item or not. The subscriber then can put those items on a "pending" list so they can import it later after they have finished browsing all the products available in the market.

	List of source websites:

		1. AliExpress.
		2. Amazon US.
		3. Banggood (Available from Web Application).
		4. Adihara (Coming soon).


* **Auto Import Product Variations** (with the images if available)
	
	Auto import product variations detail from **AliExpress** in just one click and sell products with extra choices for your customers. Convert your product into a variable products with the attributes, quantity and prices imported then distributed as how it is from AliExpress, using only a single click. Unlimited variations for each products (ie: if 1 product has 15 variations, we still count it as 1 active items).

* **Import AliExpress Product Categories**

	(AliExpress and BangGood - Required DROPSHIX Webapp) Now you can import product categories and its structure with one click of a button. Sync your products on WooCommerce with the source store products by its categories. Easier for a fresh start webstore, setting up product categories is not something you must do anymore.

* **Automatic Ordering/Purchasing tool** *(New release, Require Web Application and Chrome Extension installed)*

	After an order made by your customer, you will need to order the item to the source store. With a single click you can start auto order to the vendor store with the correct data for the product details, no more hard labor selecting everything one by one. DROPSHIX will do it for you and run the automation on a single button click. (**NOTE: Currently only available for AliExpress products.**)

* **Re-Queue Broken Items** 
	
	Resetting a product will normally leave leftover files like images, DROPSHIX clean up your leftover images when you deactivate or re-queue your obselete products. Making sure your WooCommerce website is optimized.

* **Price Configuration Profile**

	The profit configuration profil system will automate the pricing of your items the moment you import the item. You can set the profit margin for every entry level based on price range you want to have for items sold in your store, set how much difference should the plugin tolerate for changes and how many often before your product price needs to be changed.
	
* **Stock and Price Monitoring/Analytic**

	Algorithm that will check the price movement of an item every 6 hours, the tool then will collect information, mark an item if there is a difference between the data, calculate if there is any possible lost with the profit setting that has been made and automatically updates the item data in your store. Monitor your product price with the changes from the source store. 4 times a day your price will be auto calculated with the source store data. Making sure that you won't lose any profit.

* **Shipping Tracker**

	After an order made by your customer, you will need to order the item to the source store. Then normally to provide your customer with shipping tracking you will need to copy and paste from your order details page in AliExpress. Now, you can easily put in the order number and track number, save it to Dropshix, then store the secure token for that tracking in your WooCommerce order detail dashboard. Then your customer can monitor their purchase shipping right through your store on /my-account/view-order/ page. Making your store looks more professional and trustworthy, thus will bring more profit to you.
